// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

x = 2
y=3
print(x-y)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

num = input(]
if: num /2
print ("this number is even")
else:
print("this number is odd")
// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers. 
num = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
avg = sum(num)/List(num)
print(avg)
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
print(min(num))
print(max(num))
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

the avg is calculated by dividing the sum by the amount of numbers. 3 is the avg
the lowest number in the list is 1 and the largest number is 5
